Employee Performance & Retention Analysis
This project analyzes employee performance and attrition trends using probability, statistics, machine learning, and deep learning.
The dataset contains employee information such as demographics, salary, years at the company, performance scores, and attrition status.
The goal is to:
Understand employee performance and retention patterns
Predict attrition (classification task)
Predict performance scores (regression task)
Generate actionable insights and recommendations
